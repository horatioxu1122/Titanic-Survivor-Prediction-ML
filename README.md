# Titanic-Survivor-Prediction-ML
The goal of this project is simple-to predict what kind of passengers survived on the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. While there were elements of luck for some individuals to survive, but certain people were more likely to survive than others. Two datasets were given. Train.csv contain details of a subset of the passengers and that includes information of whether they had survived. Test.csv contains details of another subset of passengers but that does not include information of whether they had survived, therefore, this file is used to test model. Both datasets are downloaded from kaggle, an online community for machine learning and data science practitioners.
