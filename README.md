# Titanic-Survivor-Prediction-ML
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after striking an iceberg on April 15th, 1912. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died. The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life. It has become one of the most famous shiips in history. <br/>
While there were elements of luck for some individuals to survive, but certain people were more likely to survive than others. We want to use information given to us to discover this pattern. <br/>
Two datasets were given. Train.csv contain details of a subset of the passengers and that includes information of whether they had survived. Test.csv contains details of another subset of passengers but that does not include information of whether they had survived, therefore, this file is used to test model.<br/>
